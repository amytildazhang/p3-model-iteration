#
# Feature filtering
# 
# As an early step, some basic unsupervised feature filtering can be performed
# independently on each feature data type (rna, cnv, var).
#
# The type of filtering performed include:
#
#  1. Minimum variance
#  2. Maximum correlation
#
# For variance-based filtering, a quantile ranging from 0-1 may be specified and all
# features with variances lower than that quantile will be excluded. For example, if a
# min_var_quantile values of "0.4" is specified, the bottom 40% of features, in terms of
# their variances, will be dropped.
#
# For correlation-based filtering, a maximum pearson correlation score may be specified
# and, for each pair of features with a correlation value above the specified cutoff,
# one of the two features will be removed at random.

#
# Feature selection
# 
# Once the feature data has been filtered and combined into a single training set, a
# more sophisticated supervised feature selection approach may be applied.
# 
# Feature selection is performed using the Boruta wrapper method  with the Ranger
# implementation of random forests.
